# RISC-V_Tape_Out_Week_2
`28/09/2025` → `04/10/2025`
This report explains the core concepts of System-on-Chip (SoC) design and provides practical exposure through the functional modeling of VSDBabySoC, using open-source EDA tools like Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.
## Objective
- Develop a solid understanding of **VSDBabySoC architecture**, covering its processor, peripherals, and memory components.
- Gain practical experience by performing **functional modeling** of the BabySoC in Verilog HDL.
- Conduct **simulations and verify design behavior** using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.
- Analyze the complete design flow — from **instruction processing to DAC output and waveform observation**.
- Build foundational skills for **pre-tapeout processes**, including synthesis verification, timing analysis, and netlist creation.
